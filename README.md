# Open Hardware Monitor

Monitor computer sensors

## Alerts feature

Add an alert on any sensor to trigger a sound or executable when a limit has been reached.
Use "Options" > "Max Alert Rate" to debounce alerts so that they don't repeat too often if the sensor is above the limit continuously. The default is 5 minutes
